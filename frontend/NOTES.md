- Trieve has the variants as the first-class results, rather than the products. It is not immediately clear which is the better approach, and would be easy enough to change and even provide a toggle for the user.
- Each of the variants are groups in our dataset, each group containing a chunk with different data (meant to ensure the search net catches one of them if it is relevant). Chunk types contained in each group:
    - brand_chunk
    - description_chunk (the variant description with the brand manufactured_in_str added): "Sleep Herbal Tea is a thoughtfully crafted blend of herbs with mild sedative effects which soothe the nervous system, quiet the mind, and relax the body. The herbs in Sleep Herbal Tea help you to fall asleep faster as well as promote a deeper quality of sleep so that you wake up feeling well rested and refreshed.\r\n\r\nFlavor Profile\r\nLight, Simple, Slightly Bitter, Slightly Sweet<br>Cambria, California",
